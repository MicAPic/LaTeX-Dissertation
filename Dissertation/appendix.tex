\textbf{Post title:} Why should any American company ever act responsibly again?

\textbf{Original text:} Whats the point of good corporate governance and fiscal responsibility? The companies that leveraged themselves to the moon, did stock buybacks to hyper-inflate their stock price, live on constant debt instead of good balance sheets are now being bailed out by unlimited QE. Free money to cover your mistakes. Why would anyone run a good business ever again? Just cheat and scheme and get bailed out later.

Edit: I am truly honored to be the number 1 post on WSB. To get validation from you autists and retards, the greatest American generation, is the peak moment of my life. Thank you all.

Edit 2: Many of you are saying this post is socialist. It is anti-capitalist. It is anti-wall street. It is none of that. My post is in fact about fixing capitalism so it is done the right way. Don’t reward companies that are managed poorly and don’t invest their profits wisely. Capitalism is about survival of the fittest and rewarding the winners not the schemers and cheaters. I’d rather have a profitable company that pays its workers livable wages, doesn’t use sweat shop labor, doesn’t pollute our environment, gives good quality healthcare, paid family leave, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, reinvests in improving infrastructure, keeps low debt to equity, and has a 12 month emergency fund for a black swan event. Not companies that give all the money to the CEO and Board and nothing to the workers, do stock buy-backs with profits instead of improving infrastructure or saving for emergency funds. Let the greedy poorly run companies fail so we can invest only in good quality companies that treat their workers well. We will all make tons of profits in the market with well run companies and main street America will also be able to live a decent quality life.

Edit 3: I am not a salty bear. In fact I want the market to do well. But this is not the way. Bailing out weak companies that didn’t save for a black swan event because of CEO greed is just making this bubble bigger and bigger and it will only pop worse later on.

JPow will ruin our market and the economy with this fake bubble with his printer. Let the market be free so we can shed weak companies and true capitalism can see a rise of the strong companies and the market can moon again. JPow and his printer are really helping the Wall street elite. Jpow doesn’t care about you. Now the tax payers are bailing out shadow banking. Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can’t get loans from regular banks anymore. That’s why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general -- private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer. You may become homeless and starve, but private equity, hedge fund managers, and shady billionaires will be made whole by the fed.

\textbf{Post summary:} I hate the market, and I don’t think we need to talk to each other.

\textbf{Comments summary:} Every company’s goal should be to become ‘too big to fail’ with enough employees to be worth bailing out.

\textbf{Post title:} People are risking their lives to wage war against the suits and it brings tears to my eyes to watch them do it.

\textbf{Original text:} That is not hyperbole. Money isn’t just paper used to buy cocaine and hookers. It is a physical representation of a portion of a man’s life. Make 50,000 a year in a soul sucking desk job? Taking a 50,000 position on GME is risking a year off your life to fight this good fight. The amount of years so many of you are willing to put on the line is an amazing testament to how dedicated this sub is to fucking these bastards raw. The bastards who steal thousands of years off the regular man’s lives every single day. You’re fighting the good fight, and your sacrifices will not be forgotten.

\textbf{Post summary:} The bastards who steal thousands of years off the regular man’s lives every single day.

\textbf{Comments summary:} I don’t know how to get a job, but I think that’s why I hate the fuck out of it.

\textbf{Post title:} I Pledge to Delete Robin Hood After The Great Rise. Who’s With Me?

\textbf{Original text}: Let’s show them how many of their traders are out. These fuckers are set to IPO this year, fools. Who’s trading data are you gonna sell if all of us leave? Shilling out to big money was the worst financial mistake of your pathetic wanna-be corps life. I’m out, but I’m not selling on RH until it’s motherfucking done. Collect tendies and your tax information and split. Who’s with me?

GME 5000 is not a meme.

I am not a financial advisor

\textbf{Post summary:} There are a lot of factors out there. It’s not a meme.

\textbf{Comments summary:} The market is not as bad as you think. These examples demonstrate three types of summaries: entirely new text in the first example, a line from the original post (resulting in summary, common for extractive approach) and combination of words from original post with new ones.
